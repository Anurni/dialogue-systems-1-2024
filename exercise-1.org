* Part 1. JavaScript
These exercises can be done in your browser. If you feel courageous
enough, you can start with Part 2 and get tooling to work and then
return to Part 1.

TBD
* Part 2. Getting started with JavaScript tooling
1. [[https://nodejs.org/en/download/][Download and install NodeJS]] (LTS version).
2. [[https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install][Install Yarn]] dependency manager (you might have to use 'sudo' for
   this to work). Run this in your Terminal:
   #+begin_src
   corepack enable
   #+end_src
3. Create [[https://vitejs.dev/][Vite]] starter project:
   #+begin_src
   yarn create vite
   #+end_src
   - specify the arbitrary but meaningful name
   - select Vanilla framework
   - select JavaScript variant
   - follow the further instructions
4. You will see the link to the development instance,
   i.e. http://localhost:5173/. Open it. You should see the "Hello
   Vite!" webpage.
5. Study the ~.js~ files generated by Vite. Make sure you understand
   what's going on there.
* Part 3. Your first XState program

...turn the counter logic into a state logic...
