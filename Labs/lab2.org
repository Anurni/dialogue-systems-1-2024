#+TITLE: Lab II. Basic dialogue management

* Getting started with development environment
** Preflight step 1. Create Azure account and enable speech services
1. Apply for free student credits
   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/. You should be
   able to login with your GU account.
2. Make sure that you are logged into the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
3. Create a *Resource group* (you can use search field):
   - Subscription: *Azure for students*
   - Resource group: any name
   - Region: *(Europe) North Europe*
4. Create a *Speech service*:
   - Name: any name
   - Subscription: *Azure for students*
   - Location: *(Europe) North Europe*
   - Pricing tier: *Free (F0)*
   - Resource group: group name from the previous step
5. Within your Speech Service go to: *Resourse management → Keys and
   Endpoint* and save your KEY 1.
   
** Preflight step 2. Run the example project
1. Install [[https://nodejs.org/en/download/][NodeJS]] (LTS version) and [[Download and https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install][Yarn]] 
2. Fork the example project (this project):
   https://github.com/GU-CLASP/dialogue-systems-1-2024. Clone your
   fork to your machine.
3. Go to the =Code/= folder.
4. Install all dependencies:
   #+begin_src
   yarn
   #+end_src
5. Create a file called =azure.js= with the following contents:
   #+begin_src javascript
   export const KEY = "paste your KEY 1 here";
   #+end_src
   (Note: Don't add this file to version control.)
6. Run the project:
   #+begin_src sh
   yarn dev
   #+end_src
7. Open the link that was shown in your browser,
   e.g. http://localhost:5173/
8. Allow access to you microphone.
9. When you unblock the pop-up window, and reload the page you will
   see the state inspector; this can be useful during development.

* Assignment
- Task 1 ("appointment") :: Implementation of the finite state machine.
- Task 1 ("features") :: Add some extra features to your app.
- Task 2 ("improvements") :: Describe the limitations of your app and
  try to fix them.

** Task 1. "Appointment"
#+CAPTION: Flowchart for creating an appointment
[[./img/flowchart.png]]

In this task you will need to implement the flowchart above.

I have created a starting point for you, so you basically can use the
project that you forked before:
- You will need to edit the state chart defined by =dmMachine= in =./dm.js=:
- You will need to extend the entities in the grammar (~const grammar~)
  to understand more names, times and dates.
- There are some helper functions that you can use. Feel free to add
  your own functions.
- You will also need to create a similar grammar to understand “yes”
  and “no”, but also “of course”, “no way” etc.

** Task 2. Additional features
1. Implement an auto-start of your application after 10 seconds of
   inactivity.
2. If the user is not talking, use =ASR_NOINPUT= event to tell the user
   "I didn't hear you" and re-raise the question.
3. Define an action in =setup()= section of your machine and use it whenever you want to say something. See [[https://stately.ai/docs/actions][XState documentation]] and example below. You can also do the same for listening.
   
   Example:
   #+begin_src javascript
   say: ({ context }, params) =>
     context.ssRef.send({
       type: "SPEAK",
       value: {
         utterance: params,
       },
     }),
   #+end_src

   That's how you execute this action:
   #+begin_src
   actions: [{
     type: "say",
     params: `Hello world!`,
   }]
   #+end_src

** Task 3. Improvements
 - Write a report (max 1 page) which describes errors and limitation
   of your app.
 - Try to fix some of them and briefly describe your solution in the
   report. You don't have to fix all the limitations.
 - Add your report to the repository in PDF format (=report-lab2.pdf=)
