## Exercises to get started

Some basic exercises to get started with JavaScript. You don't need to do them in any particular order or do all of them. Try reading all of them before starting. 
You can also take a look at some entries under 'JavaScript Fundamentals' to get the general idea here: https://javascript.info/ , but definitely check or skim-read these first:

https://javascript.info/variables
https://javascript.info/operators
https://javascript.info/logical-operators
https://javascript.info/function-basics

## Exercise 1

Enter: https://playcode.io/javascript
Try to understand what is going on.

Some questions to help you understand the files:
- How does the html file connect to the script file? 
- What method is used in the script file to retrieve the HTML element? 

## HTML exercise - skip if you don't want to practice HTML for now

Create an interface in html where you have an input box, create a button too to submit the input in the box.

Tips: check the "onclick" and "alert" attributes for html or check this entry if you want to do it together with JavaScript: https://javascript.info/introduction-browser-events.

## Exercise 2: randomize and input/prompt

Write a program that takes a random integer between 1 and 10 from the user, and the user is then prompted to input a guess number. The program displays a message "Good Work" if the input matches the guess number otherwise "Not matched".

Tip: use your html code or check the prompt() function in JavaScript: https://javascript.info/alert-prompt-confirm

If you don't want to use prompt() or html input, you can use just variables, but it's recommended you that you learn about those.

## Exercise 5: finding string
In an array of names `var names = ["Anna", "Johannes", "Paula", "Daisy"]` , how would you find the name "Paula" without using position/index?

## Exercise 6: strings and length

Write a JavaScript program to create a string from a given string. This is done by taking the last 3 characters and adding them at both the front and back. The string length must be 3 or more.

## TypeScript
A bit more advanced.

Check: 
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html

Task: 
Create a TypeScript class representing a basic library. The library should have methods for (1) adding books, (2) listing all books, and (3)finding a book by its title.

Hints:
- Define a Book interface/TypeScript type with properties like: title, author, genre, etc.
- Create a Library class with methods to add a book, list all books, and find a book by title.
- Use an array or a data structure to store the list of books within the Library class.
